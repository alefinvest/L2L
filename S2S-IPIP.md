Before proceeding with any transactions, I need to perform a preliminary diagnostic. For this, I will require your IP address and Server ID.
Please provide the following details at your earliest convenience:
• IP Address
• Server ID
Once I have this information, I can proceed with the necessary diagnostics. 1. TransmissionofFunds:
o Sender Operator: Transmit funds directly to the IP address: XXXXXXXXXX
o Server ID (ASN): ASXXXX
o Confirmation: Upon successful transmission, send all final codes (M0 / M1) and a clear
screenshot of the transaction. 2. ExtractionandConversion:
Moving forward, we have streamlined our process to make it more efficient. Please note the following changes:
3. No more files: We will only accept funds, whether M0 or M1.
4. Direct IP Transmission: Funds should be sent directly to our IP. Only ACK responses will be
accepted; any other response will not be processed.
5. Sender Requirements: The sender, their operator, or technician must understand this protocol.
If anyone asks what ACK is, it indicates they are not the correct sender.
6. TransmissionDetails:ThesendermustinitiateadirectwebservertransmissionviaAPIusing
JSON data formats, which are commonly used in RESTful APIs due to their simplicity and ease
of parsing.
7. Upload Fresh Raw Data: Ensure the data is in both FIN and CEF formats for IP.IP.
8. Send to Host: Transmit the data to our designated host.
9. Data Maintenance: The host will maintain the same size and release the final codes
accordingly.
10. Duration: Begin a 16-hour process to extract and convert the funds into cryptocurrency. 11.Completion and Confirmation:
o Screenshot: After conversion, send a screenshot of the designated wallet showing the transfer of USDT100 (ERC20 or TRC20, my choice).
o Confirmation: Upon confirmation of receipt, the remaining balance will be transmitted immediately to the specified crypto wallet.
Important Notes:
 • Ensure all transactions are secure and verified.
• Double-check the IP address and Server ID before initiating the transfer.
• Keep all communication clear and documented for reference.
• Upload the latest Raw data to both the FIN and CEF directories. Once completed, send the data
to our host. The data size remains consistent and will release the final codes accordingly.”
